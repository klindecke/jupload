
As always, a lot of things can be made better:

TODO list:
- RESPONSE TO (can't repeat the problem): Another thing i noticed is, when you have nbFilesPerRequest > 1 than the
maxFileSize directive isn't working proper, its uploading more per request
than it should. (i set maxFileSize to the post_max_size in bytes right? i
used 268435456 bytes = 256M)

Add a way to add property file by file, in FileData.

- Debug file output: should be enabled only in debug mode. Also: could be nice to have some more entries in the
debug menu: paste debug output, open debug file... 
- Check the wiki
- Close file (see UploadFileData.getInputStream()) just after upload, and not when all files have been uploaded. 
Currently: uploading 1000 files in one HTTP request leads to a 'too many files open' error. 
- Check that files are correctly closed during upload (uploading 1000 files leads to a 'too many files open' error).
- Metadata coming from Canon (10D, 20D, 30D) doesn't work with picture resizing: colors of the picture resized
are wrong. Prevent transmition of metadata, with the pictureTransmitMetadata parameter corrects the problem:
there is a big in the SUN JRE. TODO: make a sample, and create defect for SUN.
- When pictureTransmit Metadata is false, metadata should be removed from the file to upload, even if there is
no picture transformation (it's Ok if the file is transformed, either resized or rotated)
- Manage the 302 Moved Temporarily HTTP return code.
- Picture mode: use the JMF and Java Advanced Image I/O
- All error should result in a question to the user: do you want to send the error log?
- Add (at least) a link to the sample in http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1807811&forum_id=199107
- Allows upload from the demo site, or inform that it doesn't work.
- Picture mode: implement target picture format (to be changed to another name ?)
- Picture mode: applet parameter to control the size of the preview on the file chooser.
- Restore compatibility with standard Java application (it currently only works as an applet).
- Remove support for the deprecated applet parameter filenameEncoding.
- Also upload empty sub-directories (must be conditioned by a new applet parameter).
