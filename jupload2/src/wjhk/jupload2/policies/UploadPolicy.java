 * <ul>
 * <li>If not set, or set to a value of 0 or less, the chunk mode is disabled.
 * That is: each file will be uploaded within being splitted in pieces.
 * <li>If set to a value of 1 or more, the upload size will be never be more
 * than maxChunkSize. A file bigger will be split in several part of
 * <i>maxChunkSize</i> size, then the last part will contain the remaining, and
 * will probably be smaller than <i>maxChunkSize</i>.
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * <b>How to build the server part:</b> the server will have to 'guess' that
 * the file is splitted, and then it will have to reconstruct the uploaded file.
 * Here are the necessary informations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>When a file is chunked, the <i>jupart</i> and <i>jufinal</i> parameter
 * are given in the URL (get parameters). This identify a chunk upload. If these
 * parameters are not given, the file(s) is(are) uploaded in one piece.
 * <li><i>jupart</i> identify the part number: from 1 to N for a file being
 * plitted in N pieces. The N-1 chunks should be <i>maxChunkSize</i> bytes
 * long. The last one contains the remaining of the file.
 * <li><i>jufinal</i> is set to 0 for chunks from 1 to N-1. It is is set to 1
 * only for the last chunk (N, in this 'example').
 * <li>The uploaded filename is not modified when the upload is chunked.
 * Example: upload of the file <i>bigPicture.jpeg</i>, of 4,5 Mb, with chunk of
 * 2Mb. The upload is splitted in three chunk. Chunk 1 and 2 are 2Mb long. The
 * third one is 0,5Mb long. The uploaded filename for these three uploads is
 * <i>bigPicture.jpeg</i>. It's up to the server part to read the <i>jupart</i>
 * and <i>jufinal</i> get parameters, to understand that the upload is chunked.
 * <li><b>Important:</b> The server script <u>must</u> check the resulting
 * filesize. If not, the client can send a file of any size, and fill the server
 * hard drive.
 * <li>The wwwroot/pages/parseRequest.jsp is a java example of a server page
 * that can receive chunk upload. It stores each chunk is <i>filename.partN</i>
 * (where N is the chunk number), then construct the final file, by
 * concatenating all parts together.
 * </ul>
 * <b>Note: </b> If nbFilesPerRequest is different than 1, the applet will try
 * to upload the files until the sum of their content length is less than
 * maxChunkSize. The upload is triggered just before the sum of their content
 * length is bigger then maxChunkSize.<br>
 * If one file is bigger than <i>maxChunkSize</i>, all previous files are
 * uploaded (at once or not, depending on nbFilesPerRequest). Then the 'big'
 * file is uploaded alone, splitted in chunk. Then upload goes on, file by file
 * or not, depending on <i>nbFilesPerRequest</i>. </td>

 * <ul>
 * <li>If <i>maxChunkSize</i> is not set, negative or 0, <i>maxFileSize</i>
 * should be the maximum upload size of the server. In this case, it is useful
 * only to display a message when the user select a file that will be refused by
 * the server.
 * <li>If chunk upload is activated, this parameter becomes really important:
 * in this case the maximum file size of an uploaded file is ... the available

 * uploaded. Since version 1.9.2rc4 this parameter is not mandatory anymore.
 * Instead, if omitted or a <i>relative</i> URL is given, the resulting URL is
 * constructed from the applet's DocumentBaseURL. This means, that if the applet
 * tag is dynamically constructed from a PHP script without specifying
 * <code>postURL</code>, the <i>same</i> same script receives the subsequent
 * POST request(s). If this URL may change during the applet execution time, you
 * can call the setProperty applet method from javascript, or create a new
 * UploadPolicy class and either :
 * <ul>
 * <li>Override the {@link wjhk.jupload2.policies.UploadPolicy#getPostURL()}
 * method, to make the postURL totaly dynamic.
 * <li>Override the
 * {@link wjhk.jupload2.policies.UploadPolicy#setPostURL(String)} method, to
 * modify the postURL on the fly, when it is changed.
 * <li>Override the
 * {@link wjhk.jupload2.policies.UploadPolicy#setProperty(String, String)}
 * method. The {@link wjhk.jupload2.policies.CoppermineUploadPolicy} changes the
 * postURL when the albumID property changes.
 * <li>Find another solution ...
 * </ul>
 * <u>Note 1:</u> in HTTP, the upload is done in the same user session, as the
 * applet uses the cookies from the navigator. This allows right management
 * during upload, on the server side.<br>
 * <u>Note 2:</u> FTP URL should looks like:
 * ftp://username:password@myhost.com:21/directory<br>
 * <u>Note 3:</u> in FTP, you'll have to add the jakarta-commons-oro.jar and
 * jakarta-commons-net.jar jar files in the applet ARCHIVE tag attribute. See

 * configured. There are 4 possible settings:<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>none</i> (default): Any server cert is accepted, no cert-based
 * client authentication is performed.</li>
 * <li><i>server</i>: The server cert is verified against the local truststore
 * and if that fails, a dialog pops up which asks the user if the certificate
 * shall be accepted permanently, just for the current session or not at all
 * (Just like any browser would do).</li>
 * <li><i>client</i>: A user-certificate (which must be available in the local
 * keystore) is used to perform client authentication.</li>
 * <li><i>strict</i>: The combination of <i>client</i> and <i>server</i>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The location of the local truststore and keystore uses the normal JRE
 * conventions. This means, that the system truststore is used for verifying
 * server certs (usually in $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts) unless either the
 * system property <i>javax.net.ssl.trusStore</i> specifies another location or
 * a file <b>.truststore</b> exists in the user's home directory. If the user
 * decides to permanently accept an untrusted certificate, the file
 * <b>.truststore</b> in the user's home directory is written. The default
 * keystore (for client certificates) is the file <b>.keystore</b> in the
 * user's home directory. This can be overridden by setting the system property
 * <i>javax.net.ssl.keyStore</i>. If the name of the keystore ends in <b>.p12</b>,
 * it is assumed that the keystore is in <b>PKCS12</b> format, otherwise the
 * default format as specified in the JRE security-configuration is used.
 * <p>
 * <b>Important Note about client authentication:</b>
 * <p>
 * At the time of this writing, a <i>serious</i> bug exists in apache 2.0.x
 * which prevents POST requests when SSL renegotiation is about to happen.
 * Renegotiation is triggered by a location-based (or directory-based) change of
 * the SSLVerifyClient directive in apache. Therefore you <b>can not</b>
 * protect a sub-area of an otherwise unprotected SSL server. You can circumvent
 * that by setting up a virtualhost which is configured to perform SSL client
 * verification <b>for the complete virtualhost</b>. Attached to the bug report
 * at <a href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12355">ASF
 * Bugzilla</a>, there are several patches which claim to fix the problem.
 * However in that same report, other users complain about those patches to be
 * ineffective. Therefore, the author recommends avoiding re-negotiation
 * alltogether by using the virtualhost aproach described above. It is the
 * understanding of the author, that this bug has been fixed for apache 2.2,
 * however the author did not verify that. Test-Reports from users running
 * apache 2.2 are welcome.</td>
